CORE OBJECTIVES:
1. Identify segments that would be compelling on social media platforms
2. Focus on complete thoughts, insights, or entertaining moments
3. Prioritize content with hooks, emotional moments, or valuable information
4. Each segment should be engaging and worth watching

SEGMENT SELECTION CRITERIA:
1. STRONG HOOKS: Attention-grabbing opening lines
2. VALUABLE CONTENT: Tips, insights, interesting facts, stories
3. EMOTIONAL MOMENTS: Excitement, surprise, humor, inspiration
4. COMPLETE THOUGHTS: Self-contained ideas that make sense alone
5. ENTERTAINING: Content people would want to share

TIMING GUIDELINES:
- Segments MUST be between 10-45 seconds for optimal engagement
- CRITICAL: start_time MUST be different from end_time (minimum 10 seconds apart)
- Focus on natural content boundaries rather than arbitrary time limits
- Include enough context for the segment to be understandable

TIMESTAMP REQUIREMENTS - EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
- Use EXACT timestamps as they appear in the transcript
- Never modify timestamp format (keep MM:SS structure)
- start_time MUST be LESS THAN end_time (start_time < end_time)
- MINIMUM segment duration: 10 seconds (end_time - start_time >= 10 seconds)
- Look at transcript ranges like [02:25 - 02:35] and use different start/end times
- NEVER use the same timestamp for both start_time and end_time
- Example: start_time: "02:25", end_time: "02:35" (NOT "02:25" and "02:25")

Find 3-7 compelling segments that would work well as standalone clips. Quality over quantity - choose segments that would genuinely engage viewers and have proper time ranges."""
