# Fuck OpusClip.

... because good video clips shouldn't cost a fortune or come with ugly watermarks.

OpusClip charges $15-29/month and slaps watermarks on every free video. SupoClip gives you the same AI-powered video clipping capabilities - completely free, completely open source, and completely watermark-free, while still providing you with a hosted version, that doesn't cost the same amount as your mortgage.

## Why SupoClip Exists

### The OpusClip Problem

OpusClip is undeniably powerful. It's an AI video clipping tool that can turn long-form content into viral short clips with features like:

- AI-powered clip generation from long videos
- Automated captions with 97%+ accuracy
- Virality scoring to predict viral potential
- Multi-language support (20+ languages)
- Brand templates and customization

**But here's the catch:**

- **Free plan limitations**: Only 60 minutes of processing per month
- **Watermarks everywhere**: Every free video gets branded with OpusClip's watermark
- **Expensive pricing**: $15/month for Starter, $29/month for Pro
- **Processing limits**: Even paid plans have strict minute limits
- **Vendor lock-in**: Your content and workflows are tied to their platform

### The SupoClip Solution

→ ✅ **Completely Free** - No monthly fees, no processing limits

→ ✅ **No Watermarks** - Your content stays yours
